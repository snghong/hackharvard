## Inspiration

Our original motivation came from one of our team members skipping the terms of conditions like they were nothing, and other another one bugging them about it. 

The reason someone keeps on pursuing a goal is as important as the reason they started, and hence some source of motivation was a documentary called [Terms and Conditions May Apply](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084953/) and an article by CNN business about [the worst terms of services ever](https://money.cnn.com/gallery/technology/2014/05/13/worst-terms-of-service/index.html).

A study conducted at the Boston College Law Review by Uri Benoliel called [The Duty to Read the Unreadable](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3313837) gives us these statistics:
- 70% of agreements had an average sentence length of more than 25
- The median Flesch Reading Ease was 34, the recommended is 60.
- The median Flesch-Kncald score was 15 years of school.

Our concerns were fully validated when we got to know that a massive tech company like Google admitted to the unreadability of its own Terms of Service in 2012 and now attempts to make it as readable as possible, but this is just an appearance of a needle in a haystack.
## What it does

The main product is the python backend, with our in-house flask-based WebApp API, which we can use for many of our goals, a chrome extension, a flutter-based android and ios app, and Qt-based local apps on mac and windows. This forms somewhat of a microservice architecture.

The microservice we were able to fully develop and use as a proof of concept was the chrome extension, due to its low requirements.
